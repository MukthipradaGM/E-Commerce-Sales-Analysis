# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis

Tableau, a data visualization tool, was used to analyze the sales of an e-commerce website. The dashboard created is highly interactive, displaying sales variation year over year, month over month, and state over state. It also includes graphs that show the most popular products and the revenue generated by them. Many filters are used, such as context filters and measure filters. It also includes a line graph, which aids in forecasting the website's future market.
